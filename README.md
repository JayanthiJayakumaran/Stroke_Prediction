# Stroke_Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a stroke based on various health parameters. Stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and early prediction can significantly aid in timely medical intervention. The model leverages patient health data and uses predictive analytics to identify high-risk individuals.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes several attributes such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, ever married, work type, Residence_type, average glucose level, bmi, and smoking status. The data is sourced from the Kaggle website.

## Features
- **Age**: Age of the patient
- **Hypertension**: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
- **Heart Disease**: 0 if the patient has no heart disease, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
